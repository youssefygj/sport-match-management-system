# sport-match-management-system

This project aims to implement a system that efficiently manages matches played in any sport, along with tracking fan attendance to these matches. The system provides a comprehensive set of features and functionalities to meet the requirements of sports associations, clubs, stadiums, tickets, fans, and system administrators.

Key Features:

Sports Association Manager: Allows association managers to create, edit, and delete matches played by different clubs.
Matches: Manages matches between two clubs, including start time, end time, and the maximum number of attendees. Each match is hosted in a specific stadium.
Clubs: Enables clubs to schedule and play matches throughout the season. Each club has a representative responsible for obtaining permission to host matches.
Stadiums: Manages stadiums, including capacity, location, and availability. Stadium managers approve or disapprove club requests for hosting matches.
Tickets: Facilitates the sale of tickets for matches. Each ticket is associated with a specific match and stadium, and its status is updated as sold or available.
Fans: Allows fans to purchase tickets and attend matches. Fan profiles include personal information such as name, national ID, birth date, address, and phone number.
System Admin: Provides administrative functions such as adding/deleting clubs, stadiums, and temporarily blocking fans from using the system.
User Authentication: Users are required to log in with a username and password to access the system.
